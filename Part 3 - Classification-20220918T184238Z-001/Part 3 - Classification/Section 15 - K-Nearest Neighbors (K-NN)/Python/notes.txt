Steps
1. choose the number, K, of neighbors (common default is 5)
2. take the K nearest neighbors of the new data point, according to distances (i.e. Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.)
3. among these K neighbors, count the number of data points in each category 
4. assign the new data point to the category where you counted the most neighbors

Euclidean Distance
distance between P1 and P2 = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
