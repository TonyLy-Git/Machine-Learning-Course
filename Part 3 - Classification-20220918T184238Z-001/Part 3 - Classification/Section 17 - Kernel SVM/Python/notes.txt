Kernel SVM Intuition
used when we can't find the boundary with a linear line
when the data points are non LINEARLY SEPARABLE

A Higher-Dimensional Space
Steps
1. create a function based on the data points 
    ex) f = x - 5
2. map the function into the next dimensional space 
    ex) f = (x - 5)^2
3. project the points onto the new function

4. project the result back into the regulare dimensional space

Catch:
mapping to a higher dimensional space can be highly compute-intensive
