how SVM searches for the line that separates points into classes?
the line is searched through the maximum margin
the line is equidistant from the closes point in each classes
the closes points are called support vectors - they contribute to the algorithm

maximum margine hyperplane - the line that separates the classes
positive/negative hyperplane stems from the edge of the maximum margin and is parallel to the maximum marin hyperplane
generally left of the maximum margin hyperplane is negative and the right is positive

why SVM? 
in the example of apples and oranges
predominate ML algorithms looks at the most common type of apples to determine what an apple is
svm looks the apples that are not the standard apples to determine what an apple looks like
