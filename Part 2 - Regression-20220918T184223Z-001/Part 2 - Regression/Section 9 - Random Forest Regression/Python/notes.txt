Random Forest Intuition

Random forest is a version of Ensemble Learning

Ensemble Learning - take mult algorithm and put them together 

Step 1: pick at random K data points from training set
Step 2: build Decision Tree associated to the K data points
Step 3: choose the number Ntree of trees you want to build and repeat Steps 1 & 2
Step 4: for a new data point, make each one of your Ntree trees predict the value of Y for the data point in question, and assign the new point the average across all of the predicted Y values

Ensemble algorithms are more stable because any changes within the dataset can heavily impact a single tree compared to a forest of trees
